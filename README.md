### Problem:
```
Mixed solid waste, low recycler discovery, and inefficient pickups increase pollution and landfill load.
```
### Solution:
```
A marketplace + logistics layer: list waste → match to eligible recycler/collector → scheduled pickup → verified handover → payment/credits → municipal fallback if unmatched
```
